# Virtual-Try-On-Closet

This is the repository for the 2024 Seasons Of Code project namely "Virtual Try-On closet Using GAN"

## Description
Create a virtual try-on system that allows users to upload their images and see how different clothes look on them. This involves understanding body postures and sizes, and overlaying clothing items realistically. Technologies: Computer Vision, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), OpenCV, PyTorch.
