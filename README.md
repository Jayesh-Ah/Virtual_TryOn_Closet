# ðŸ‘š Virtual Try-On Closet
2024 Seasons Of Code Project

## ðŸ›  Project Overview
The Virtual Try-On Closet is an ongoing project that aims to create a virtual try-on system using cutting-edge Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Computer Vision techniques. The goal is to allow users to upload their images and visualize how different clothing items would look on them. The system intelligently analyzes body posture, size, and other physical attributes to overlay the clothing in a realistic manner. This project leverages PyTorch and advanced machine learning models to bring virtual fashion try-ons to life.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **`Python`**: Core programming language for model implementation.
- **`PyTorch`**: Deep learning framework used to build and train GANs.
- **`Neural Networks`**: Applied for various tasks like image generation, pose estimation, and object detection.
- **`OpenCV`**: For image processing and handling computer vision tasks.
- **`Computer Vision`**: Detects and understands human body postures, facial attributes, and object locations.
- **`Edge Detection`**: Enhances the accuracy of clothing overlays.
- **`Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`**: Utilized for image recognition and segmentation tasks.
- **`RESNET`**: Used for object localization and detection tasks.
- **`Object Detection & Localization`**: Ensures accurate placement of clothing items on user images.
- **`Face Recognition & Verification`**: Used for user identification and personalization of the virtual try-on experience.
- **`Neural Style Transfer`**: Implements style blending and clothing pattern application.
- **`Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)`**: Core technology enabling the generation of realistic clothing overlays on user images.
- **`Semantic Segmentation`**: To accurately segment human figures and clothing items.
- **`Pose Estimation`**: Ensures that clothing items fit the user's body posture realistically.
## ðŸš§ Ongoing Development
This project is currently in development, with additional features and improvements being continuously integrated. We are working on enhancing the accuracy of pose estimation and refining the overall user experience.
